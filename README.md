# Learning Scala - HAN

Scala implementation of a very over-simplified crypto-currency.

**Note: This is not a real crypto-currency! The code is most likely not secure 
and should thus not be used in ANY production environment. The project was merely 
created as a programming challenge to become familiar with both the Scala 
language and blockchain technology.**
